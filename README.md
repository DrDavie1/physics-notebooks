# Quantum Eigenstates

This problem was set as a university assignment within a jupyter notebook, however, I have removed specific assignement details from the notebook and will give details here. The main_code.py file contains the functions used to solve the problem. 
#

The code consisted of 4 parts including an extension.

### Part 1

Plots a harmonic pontenial.

### Part 2

Defines a Hamiltonian matrix

### Part 3

Finds the eigen values and states for a Quantum Harmonic oscillator in 1D.

### Part 4

Finds the eigen values and states of a hydrogen atom with l = 0 in 1D and plots in 2D.

### Extension

- Finds the eigen values and states of a hydrogen atom with l > 0
- Compares the efficiency of scipy eigen problem solvers.
